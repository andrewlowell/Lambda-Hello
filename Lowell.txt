A few words that describe me: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!

My favorite hobby is underwater basket weaving. When those reeds stay wet, they just become so, so supple. I could weave those reeds for days. I spent $9,000 on scuba diving equipment, and I don't even like scuba diving. I just wanted to be able to stay under the water for longer than my already impressive 96 seconds.
